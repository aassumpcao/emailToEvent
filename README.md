# emailToEvent
Applet to create events in Apple's Calendar from Mail messages.

# Description
I have always been troubled by the limitations in Apple's Mail app, e.g. you can't drag and drop email messages onto your calendar without losing content, you can't add read receipts, you can't send emails to be delivered later, etc. Having said this, this is my small contribution to fill in the gap.

emailToEvent lets you save an email as a calendar event while keeping all relevant message information in the event content.  Just load the applet onto your automator app and you should be able to see emailtoEvent in Mail's services tab.

This is just a working version to solve my problems, so if you find it buggy or not up to your needs, let me know and we will see what we can do together to improve it (I will not be developing this further unless prompted - and helped - by someone else).

Thanks and enjoy,

Andre

# Notes
I have created an Outlook version of the script with Apple Calendar integration but it only works when you assign a keyboard shortcut from Services preferences.
